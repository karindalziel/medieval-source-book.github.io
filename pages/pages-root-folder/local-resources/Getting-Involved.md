Getting involved in the Pittsburgh DH scene is easy. Keep an eye on the PGH\|DH [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mbn72lmqv0qcrb9o6t6imo1bbk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) and [website](http://pghdh.net/), sign up for the listservs at [Pitt](https://list.pitt.edu/mailman/listinfo/dhrx) and [CMU](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/dh-cmu), and check out the communities at Pitt ([DHRX](https://dhrx.pitt.edu)) and CMU ([dSHARP](http://dsharp.library.cmu.edu/)).

There are events going on nearly weekly, and the best place to hear about those are the listservs mentioned above. The DH community here is quite friendly, so if you'd like to get more involved, just reach out to your local DHer and ask.
