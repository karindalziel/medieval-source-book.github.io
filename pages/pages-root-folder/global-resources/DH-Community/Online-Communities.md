Many online communities exist to facilitate DH discussion. Sometimes they are diffuse and difficult to link to, as in DH blogging, but others are centralized:

- [**DHSlack**](https://digitalhumanities.slack.com). A slack channel dedicated to DH discussion, questions, and answers. Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdixlWvNtl2zrrodX9YzP4OmQ0xk5AwPEGZ0qxvlg9nbRReMw/viewform).
- [**HASTAC**](https://www.hastac.org/). A popular social network site predating facebook focused on connecting people at the intersection of the humanities, arts, science, and technology.
- [**#digitalhumanities on twitter**](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23digitalhumanities&src=typed_query). Although a single hashtag can't contain it, this is a good place to start when looking for digital humanists on twitter. Twitter contains perhaps the largest and most active web-based DH community.
