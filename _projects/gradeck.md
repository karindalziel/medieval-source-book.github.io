The video describes what civic data intermediaries and how they assemble, transform, and maintain data; disseminate data; and use data to impact local governance. It focuses on the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center and the types of open access, free data that it compiles and makes accessible to any interested user. It gives examples of projects done with the data and provides information for further training in using these different types of civic data.
