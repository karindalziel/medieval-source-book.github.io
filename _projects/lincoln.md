This video discusses network analysis in the context of art history. It shows how network analysis was used to examine networks of Dutch printmaking collaborations to study change in the industry decade by decade. The video notes that a number of other digital humanities tools and methods were used to build the dataset before it could be studied with network analysis software, such as web scraping of museum websites to gather information about pieces of art and using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to manipulate and analyze the data.

This journal special issue collects several articles on art historical network analysis that demonstrate a variety of approaches and research questions in a thoughtful and critical way. A portion of the project I describe in my presentation is included as an article here. More on my research can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/mdlincoln/continuity_and_disruption).

[Matthew D. Lincoln, “Confabulation in the Humanities,” March 21, 2015](http://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html). This is a blog post that explains, through a playful example from this printmaking networks question, the dangers humanists face when coming up with interpretations upon first glancing any kind of data visualization.
