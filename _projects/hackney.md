  bio: S.E. "Shack" Hackney is a PhD candidate in Library and Information Science at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Computing and Information. They received their MSLIS with Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities from Pratt Institute’s School of Information in 2016. Their research focuses on structural inequality within digital infrastructure systems, particularly within the realm of digital character-encoding standards, and the ways that knowledge organization systems create physical and virtual spaces that privilege certain bodies and experiences over others.

This video describes the process of taking a website, in this case one of Ufology, and then running a structure-based network analysis on it. The video discusses how to capture and analyze the structure of a website to then compare it with social structures or other projects on similar topics. The video describes steps needed to scrape a website, clean the data, and then analyze it with the network analysis tool [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

This article delves into the relationships between websites which are manifested through networks of links between sites, and proposes that such links are a form of social community building within related pages.
