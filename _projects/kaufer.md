This video describes how to use the text analysis tool DocuScope to perform close readings of a corpus. DocuScpe is an English digital dictionary and visualization environment that tags different facets of the words in a text such as human characters, public information, description, and emotions. DocuScope can be used to analyze newspaper articles, for example, to see if they are as stereotypical or biased as believed.
