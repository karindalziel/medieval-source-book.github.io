This video explores video oral history projects. It uses the online archive [The HistoryMakers](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/) to show what types of tools and resources exist to make similar types of projects as well as increasing their utility and accessibility. It discusses how to filter through large volumes of oral histories to find meaningful information for a project.
