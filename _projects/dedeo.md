This video discusses a project that explored the historical, social, and cultural implications of capitalism and democracy through a distant reading of American, British, and Dutch newspapers over two-hundred years. It shows how major historical acts have influenced the ways in which people have thought and written about the broad concepts of capitalism and democracy. This video shows how well digital humanities methods lead to interdisciplinary studies and results.
