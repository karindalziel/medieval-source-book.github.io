This video discusses eXtensible Markup Language (XML), which is a markup language that follows a set series of rules that in turn makes documents readable by humans and machines. XML is helpful for transcribing and annotating a text, for example. XML does not need to be limited to a single source. Different editions of a novel, for example, can be compared once they have been transcribed into XML.
