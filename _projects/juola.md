This video discusses the question of authorship attribution and shows how stylometry and machine learning have been able to prove the true authorship of documents. It describes the process of using the tool [JGAAP](https://github.com/evllabs/JGAAP), which proved that *Harry Potter* author J.K. Rowling also wrote the Robert Galbraith detective novel *The Cuckoo's Calling*.
