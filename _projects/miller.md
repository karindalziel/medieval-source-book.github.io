This video explores how metadata can be used to undertake a distant reading of a textual corpus, in this case 1,8000 dissertations, for the purposes of rhetorical analysis. It shows how heatmaps of metadata can provide visualizations that help lead to further analysis in R. The video also shows how to use the data cleaning tool [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) to easily convert from MARC codes into a more readable format such as CSV to TSV.

## Further Reading and Resources

I highly recommend http://openrefine.org: it’s an excellent, free tool for data inspection and transformation. OpenRefine lives in your browser, but operates locally, so you don’t have to share data with any third parties. The site includes walkthrough videos for common operations.

For inspiration and some great tutorials on data visualization, including heat maps, check out https://flowingdata.com.

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) software includes extensive built-in help pages, which I found were enough to get my bearings (especially when supplemented with web searches that mostly led to Stack Overflow). But Springer has put out several books specific to learning R for DH, including Humanities Data in R(Arnold and Tilton), Text Analysis with R for Students ofLiterature (Jockers), and CorpusLinguistics and Statistics with R (Desaguiler). I haven't read any of them, so your mileage may vary, but if I were starting again I'd probably start with one of these.

If you do get into R, before too long, you’ll likely want to use the interoperable collection of add-on packages known as “the tidyverse,” which make it easier to rearrange and re-represent your data (without having to kick it back out to openrefine). There’s a series of free courses by the creators at https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse.
