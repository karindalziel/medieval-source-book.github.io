Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that is interested in the rule-based modeling of any natural (human) language from a computational perspective. It is also interested in computational approaches to the study of traditional questions of linguistics research. Computational linguistics is practiced by computer scientists, linguists, philosophers, psychologists, and a variety of other scholars.
