Multilingual DH is a community of practice that focuses on the application of digital humanities tools and methodologies to languages other than English. English-language examples are widely used for digital humanities pedagogy, even in contexts where not everyone works with English text. Modern English is the best-resourced language in the world in terms of the algorithms that underpin many digital humanities methodologies, from text digitization to computational text analysis. For languages that use different writing systems or have very different grammar than English, it can be challenging to apply those same methodologies. Multilingual DH develops resources and documents good practices for working with text in languages around the world.
