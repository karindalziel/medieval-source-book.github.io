Digital pedagogy is the use of digital technologies for both teaching and learning. Digital pedagogy can encompass websites that include full lessons, like [SocialChange101.org](http://socialchange101.org/); online repositories of annotated primary sources, like [Seventeen Moments in Soviet History](http://soviethistory.msu.edu/); and using technology for assignments to assess student learning such as having students create a blog post or podcast instead of a traditional paper or exam. 

[Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/) offers curated and peer-reviewed pedagogical materials that are available now for reuse and re-mixing, all organized around important concepts and keywords. See the [Introduction](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/introduction) or use the [Search](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/search) to find materials based on your needs. The [Getting Started tag](https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/search/tag/Getting+started) offers entry-level assignments, syllabi, rubrics for those who are new to Digital Pedagogy.
