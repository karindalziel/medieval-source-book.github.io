Digitization is the process of taking a physical source and making a digital version of it for preservation, access, or analysis. Digitization can take many different approaches and forms.

Digitizing images such as photographs, drawings, or pages and saving them as image files (like .jpeg or .tiff) allows them to be examined for the purposes of [cultural analytics](#topic_culturalanalytics) or [digital art history](#topic_digitalarthistory). Digital images can also be housed online for [digital public history](#topic_digitalpublichistory) projects such as museum websites or online archives.

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of converting the images of text pages into editable text. Adobe Acrobat and [AbbyyFinereader](https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/finereader/what-is-ocr/) both have OCR features. The free software [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) is good for extracting text from images containing tabular data.

Another form of digitization is [3D modeling](#topic_3dmodeling). 3D models can be used for a variety of historical, artistic, or archaeological research. 3D modeling also allows for the creation of [virtual reality](#topic_virtualreality) experiences, which can be applied to a variety of disciplines such as history or English for the purposes of [digital pedagogy](#topic_digitalpedagogy).
