Data visualization, or DataViz, concerns the visual representation of data in a variety of ways including graphs, plots, [maps](#topic_hgis), and other graphics like [network](#topic_networkanalysis) visualizations.

Examples of visualization software include [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) for GIS mapping or [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and [Pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/) for networks, and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) for general purpose visualizations. 

Many of the approaches and tools for data viz come from the natural and social sciences. For some discussion of how best to apply visualization techniques to humanistic research, see [humanities visualization](#topic_humanitiesvisualization).
