teaser: "The default template for posts and pages aligns the page beautifully in the middle. <strong>But</strong> you can customize posts/pages easily via switches in the front matter to <em>get a sidebar</em> and/or to <em>turn off meta-information</em> at the end of the page like categories, tags and dates."
meta_teaser: "This is an example of a beautiful aligned post in the middle. There is no sidebar to distract the reader. The difference to the Page-Template is, that you find meta-information at the bottom of the post."

Digital history is as multifaceted as history itself, but often aligns itself with one of a few varieties:

 - Using the web, mobile apps, and other digital media to engage the public with history. See also [Digital Public History](#topic_digitalpublichistory).
 - Using computational techniques, including statistical and visual, to augment traditional research practices. See also [Computational History](#topic_computationalhistory) and [Cultural Analytics](#topic_culturalanalytics).
 - Using scanners, cameras, photogrammetry, modeling software, etc. to construct flat or 3D models of historical documents, artifacts, and buildings. Models might be used for archival, public, or research purposes. See also [3D Modeling](#topic_3dmodeling) and [Digital Editions](#topic_digitaleditions).
 - Creating complex and deep maps of the past for public or research purposes. See also [Historical GIS](#topic_hgis).
 - Using digital teaching methods and assigning the creation of multimedia objects like websites, podcasts, and videos for students of history. See also [Digital Pedagogy](#topic_digitalpedagogy).
