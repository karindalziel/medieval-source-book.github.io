3D modeling is the process of creating a three-dimensional model either through computer software or through 3D printing. 3D modeling serves as the basis for many [Virtual Reality](#topic_virtualreality) experiences. 3D models can be "drawn" by hand in a computer or created through the use of videos or photographs. Creating 3D models from photographs, especially in the case of archeology, is known as photogrammetry.
