HGIS stands for historical geographic information system. Most often, this means using mapping software to display or analyze geographic data in order to answer historical questions. Although most often used for environmental history, HGIS lends well to a variety of historical methodologies such as social and economic history. HGIS is a form of [Digital History](#topic_digitalhistory).

HGIS research can be done with a variety of webplatforms as well as desktop software such as:
 -  The website [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/).
 -  The ESRI webplatform [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html)
 -  The open source desktop software [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
 -  The licensed desktop software [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview)
