Latinx Digital Humanities centers the ["heritage, history, language, and ethnic identity"](https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pdtc.2019.48.issue-1/pdtc-2018-0031/pdtc-2018-0031.xml) of the [transnational, exile, native, and immigrant peoples](https://recoveryprojectappblog.wordpress.com/2018/11/06/new-hilt-course-on-digital-humanities-latinx-studies/) who make up the Latinx community. It finds its historical roots in the recovery work of groups like the University of Houston's "Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage" project, and in the writing of Chicana feminists like Gloria Anzaldúa and Cherríe Moraga, offering, as María Cotera writes, a "new praxis of Chicana feminism at the intersection of digital and analog culture." It aims, in the words of Lorena Gauthereau, to use DH ["to reclaim lost histories, reveal injustices, and demand that our voices be heard."](https://recoveryprojectappblog.wordpress.com/2019/02/21/digital-hispanisms-using-third-world-feminism-in-dh/) Latinx DH can sometimes be found under #usldh
