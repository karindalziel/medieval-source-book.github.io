Digital forensics is a form of forensic science that seeks to recover and investigate materials stored on digital devices. A practitioner of digital forensics can take metadata, for example, and use it to determine authorship of documents. Similar techniques can also be used to determine if a digital document has been tampered with or falsified in any way.
