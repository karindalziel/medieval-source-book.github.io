Stylometry is the study of style in text, music, images, etc. It is often employed in attributing authorship to anonymous or disputed documents. An example of authorship attribution research is the unveiling of JK Rowling as the pseudonymous author of *The Cuckoo's Calling*. Stylometry is occasionally used in conjunction with [Digital Forensics](#topic_digitalforensics).

Stylomety can be performed with the [JGAAP tool](https://github.com/evllabs/JGAAP).
