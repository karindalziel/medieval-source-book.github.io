Public history consists of tasks such as historic preservation and collecting [oral histories](#topic_oralhistory) as well as storing and disseminating historical information through archives and museums. Digital public history is a branch of public history that includes the electronic collection, storage, or access of public history materials. In 2015, [the Joint Task Force on Public History Education and Employment](https://ncph.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/What-do-Public-History-Employers-Want-A-Report-of-the-Joint-Task-Force-on-Public-History-Education-and-Employment.pdf) found that while public history employers still highly value traditional historical skills such as research and writing, historiographical knowledge, and oral and written communication, employers in public history are increasingly seeking candidates that have skills related to digital media, fund-raising, and project management. Thus, those interested in public history should also have a knowledge of related digital applications of traditional public history approaches. Examples of digital public history include  [The History Makers](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/), [The US Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/collections/the-museums-collections/about/oral-history), and [The Charles "Teenie" Harris Archive](https://cmoa.org/art/teenie-harris-archive/).
