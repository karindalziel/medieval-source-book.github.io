Distant reading, as the name suggests, is set in opposition to the form of literary analysis known as close reading. Instead of focusing on textual minutiae, distant reading focuses on the generalities of a text or texts, often via computational means. A frequent objective of distant reading is not to scrutinize a particular work, but to see texts in relation to one another as part of a system.
