Critical code studies is a broad field that brings together digital humanities, software studies, cultural studies, computer science, and human-computer interaction. The main focus of the field is to study the cultural importance of computer code. The idea is to examine a piece of code with the same emphasis on nuance and understanding as examining a piece of literature.
