DH postcolonialism is the application of key facets of postcolonial studies such as critiques of colonialism, imperialism, and globalization and their relationships to race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability to digital humanities. Much like [DH Feminism](#topic_dhfeminism) aims to bring more women and approaches of feminist studies to DH, DH post-colonialism aims to decolonize digital studies.
