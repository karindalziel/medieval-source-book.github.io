Text mining and analytics is the process of deriving information by way of statistical pattern learning from text. In many cases, this is a stage after [digitization](#topic_digitization), although text is often born-digital. Text is formatted in a structured fashion and then a computer program derives patterns from the text, which can then in turn be evaluated and interpreted. Text analytics often relies on natural language processing (NLP), a field that explores the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. Some examples of applied analytics processes are information retrieval from a corpus, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis.
