Network analysis is the study of relations and structures (often social) by way of networks and graph theory. Network analysis is one of the more popular DH methods used in [Digital History](#topic_digitalhistory) as well as literature and cultural studies and [Digital Art History](#topic_digitalarthistory). Two common tools for network analysis are [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and [Pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/).

For an example of how network analysis can be used to further historical research see [Ku Klux: The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction](https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl60CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=parsons+klan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnhtX7vOLjAhVMheAKHS5rDPEQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=parsons%20klan&f=false) (2015) by Elaine Frantz Parsons. For examples of how network analysis bridges both intellectual history and literary and cultural studies see either the [Six Degrees of Francis Bacon](http://www.sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com/?ids=10000473&min_confidence=60&type=network) or [Carolingian Networks](https://digitalhumanities.duke.edu/projects/carolingian-networks) projects.
