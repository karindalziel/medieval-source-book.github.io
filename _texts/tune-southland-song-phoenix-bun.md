## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further. Later, he became a bureaucrat and was posted to many cities as a prefect of the imperial court. In his political life, he was principled and solemn, and wrote a great deal in many genres. Much of his writing reflects his dignified character. His song lyrics, however, provide an interesting contrast. Their content may be drawn in part from the colorful private life he enjoyed in his younger years, including liaisons with many different courtesans. Interestingly, they are often written from the perspective of a lovelorn courtesan abandoned by an inconstant lover, in effect casting himself as the villain.</p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-9d4ac392-7fff-556c-e39a-8f514db81355">This song lyric portrays scenes in the life of a newlywed couple, focusing on the emotions of the wife. In the first stanza, she is putting on her makeup and styling her hair. In order to win the favor of the husband, she dresses carefully and asks him his opinion. The next stanza depicts her doing embroidery, a traditional hobby for women at that time. </p>
