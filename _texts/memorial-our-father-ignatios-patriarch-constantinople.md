## Introduction to the Source 
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-07a93399-7fff-77b3-7716-bdf219155626">The <em>Menologion</em> of Basil II (<a href="https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Vat.gr.1613">Vat. ms. gr. 1613</a>) is one of the treasures of Byzantine manuscript production. The dedicatory poem tells us that it was made for the emperor Basil II (r. 976-1025), possibly early in his reign. Made in the waning years of the Macedonian dynasty, known for producing encyclopedic collections on various topics, the manuscript is a collection of illustrated saints’ lives arranged according to the church calendar. The Menologion contains entries for September through February. The consistent layout of each page comprises a title naming the saint to be commemorated and the day, an image of the saint, and brief account of their life. The richly detailed miniatures of the manuscript are all on golden ground befitting its imperial recipient, but they are also important as one of the few instances of medieval art where we know the artist’s name. Each miniature is accompanied by the name of one of eight artists, presumably the person who painted it. </p> <p>Contrary to its name, the book is more properly a <em>synaxarion</em>. Both <em>synaxaria</em> and <em>menologia</em> collect and list saints according to their celebration in the church calendar, but menologia generally have longer lives and often include prayers or other relevant texts for the celebration of each saint. <em>Synaxaria</em> contain much shorter notices, varying from a simple line of remembrance up to the paragraph length of the <em>Menologion</em>.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This text tells the story of the patriarch Ignatios celebrated on October 23. Ignatios, who also has his own full-length <em>vita</em>, was the son of the emperor Michael I (r. 811-13) and was castrated when his father abdicated. The image that accompanies his text here accurately reflects the physiological effects of castration: his hair is gray; his face is beardless and boyish though marked with deep wrinkles.</p> <p>The text differs from other accounts of Ignatios’ life in several aspects. Ignatios is probably best known for his part in the so-called Photian Schism. The political circumstances surrounding the schism are complex, but in this particular conflict the fates of the patriarchs and emperors were intertwined. Ignatios became patriarch in 847 under Theodora (r. 842–56, the wife of Theophilos, r. 829-42, and mother and regent of Michael III, r. 842-67). In 858 when Michael III was sole ruler, Ignatios was deposed and replaced by Photios, who was a learned layman, favored in the imperial bureaucracy. Ignatios’ partisans went to Rome and won the support of the pope. When Basil I (r. 867-86) murdered Michael III, he was faced with a number of political constraints, including the need for Western support, and so he restored Ignatios to office. Ignatios remained there until his death in 877 at which point Photios became patriarch once more. He served until he was deposed again in favor of another (likely castrated) imperial son, Stephen, in 886.</p> <p>The text of the <em>Menologion</em> condenses and modifies the complexity of this back and forth, especially in the last part. It erases Photios’ second term and reports that Ignatios did not die in office but retired to a monastery. Further, the entry highlights Ignatios’ imperial pedigree. In sum, as it appears in the <em>Menologion</em>, the narrative stresses the connections between imperial family and patriarchate. The office passes from Ignatios to Stephen, the son of the founder of the Macedonian dynasty, Basil I, and the great, great grandfather of the original recipient, Basil II.</p>
