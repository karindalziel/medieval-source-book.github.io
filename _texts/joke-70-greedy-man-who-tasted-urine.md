    Facetia LXX Joke 70 Curialis unus e nostris notae avaritiae, saepe mensam familiae accedebat, dum comederet, degustans vinum, an satis aquatum esset: A colleague of ours in the curia, known for his greed, would often come to the servants’ table while taking his dinner to taste the wine to see if it was watered enough. simulabat autem se id agere, ut bono vino uterentur. However, he only pretended to do this so that they would use the good wine. Hoc cum animadvertissent nonnulli, tandem communicato consilio recentem quandoque urinam pro vino in mensa supposuere, qua hora venturum hominem suspicabantur. When some servants noticed this, they made a plan and at the hour they suspected the man would attend, they placed fresh urine on the table instead of wine. Accessit ille more suo, et cum urinam bibisset, nauseans ac semieructans, magno clamore abscessit, minatus multa illis qui haec conati essent. He arrived in his usual way and when he had drunk the urine, he got nauseous and almost threw up, he left the place with loud shouts and made great threats against the ones who had planned this. Illi vero risu cenam finierunt. The servants then finished their meal with laughter. Hoc eius rei machinator mihi postmodum retulit multo cum risu. All of this was told to me later with much laughter by the perpetrator of the act.

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The <em>Facetiae</em> seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The <em>Facetiae</em> was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or ‘conversations’ were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (to Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the <em>Facetiae</em> seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.</p> <p>Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporaries, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the <em>Facetiae</em>, but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as Conversations (<em>Confabulationes</em>), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his <em>Facetiae</em> are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The <em>Facetiae</em> as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the <em>Facetiae</em>, Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s The Hermaphrodite, which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).</p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c16627c1-7fff-b5bc-0e5f-6db0bb66254c">This joke recounts a burlesque story of greed being punished.</p>
