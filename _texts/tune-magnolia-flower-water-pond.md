## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose) his <em>ci</em> compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the <em>ci</em> of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness.</p> <p>In this <em>ci</em>, the speaker recalls when he first met a beautiful woman. The first and final lines relate to the present, framing the old memories which make up the middle section of the song. This creates a contrast between the sorrowful and solitary present and the celebratory atmosphere when he first met his lover. The “flowers” mentioned in the closing lines have a double meaning: they are both flowering trees in the gardens where banquets were held and, even more, the female singers and dancers who entertained at those banquets, like the young woman the poet recalls in the first stanza.</p>
