  De Muliere Mala
Concerning the Wicked Woman
Quisquis male mulieris artes malas scire queris,
May you, who seek to know the wicked tricks of Woman,
Que subscripsi coacerua, lege disce, mente serua.
Read, learn, and keep in mind the the verses written below.
Si uis tandem felix esse, haec ut legas est necesse.
Indeed, if you wish to be happy, it is necessary that you read these words.
Hic addisces, hic uidebis, quid dimittes, quid tenebis.
Here you will learn and see what you will dismiss and what you will remember.
Hic Caribdis atque Sille patent antra, Syrtes mille,
Here lie open the caves of Scylla and Charybdis, along with a thousand Sirtes:
Hic describo Cyrcen lenam, absorbentemque balenam.
Here I describe whorish Circe and the all-consuming whale.
Que ne formides in mari, naui uectus salutari,
So that you will not fear these threats at sea, while you sail in a salutary ship,
Deum ama, fuge scortum. Castitatis tene portum.
You should love God, flee harlotry, and seek the port of chastity.
Uersus et euersus in me, dum fabrico uersus,
While I compose my verses, I twist and turn within my mind.
Non ualeo fari, non scribere, non meditari,
I can barely speak, write, and think:
Ut fatear uerum, que sit feritas mulierum.
How can I ever tell the entire truth about the savagery of women?
Sed licet ad uotum nequeam describere totum,
Nevertheless, although I cannot describe it all, as I wish to,
Quicquid de Scilla feritatis habundat in illa,
I shall speak a little – if the Muses come to my aid –
Dicam pauca tamen, si det michi musa iuuamen.
About that Scyllan beastliness that abounds in Woman.
Prestat in orbe feris cunctis feritas mulieris,
The savagery of Woman exceeds that of all the beasts in the world;
Tygri predoni prestat, rapidoque leoni;
It puts to shame the preying tiger and swift-footed lion.
Uincitur istarum feritas, rabiesque ferarum,
On the one hand, the savagery of these creatures and the madness of all other beasts can be conquered,
Haeque
As they learn to bear the yoke and tremble at men.
Femina uero feris truculencior una seueris,
On the other hand, Woman alone is more ferocious than the fiercest beasts:
Numquam pacatur, nulla racione domatur,
She is never appeased, and can in no way be tamed.
Non homini cedit, non sponte fauet nec obedit,
She does not yield to Man, nor favour him, nor obey him.
Non ad iter recti ualet ullo uerbere flecti.
She cannot be led to the right path with beatings;
Quo uexata magis fuerit mala femina plagis,
In fact, the more a wicked woman is harried by blows,
Tanto maiorem studet exercere furorem.
The greater fury she strives to exhibit.
Nec mala desistit fieri, stimuloque resistit.
Moreover, she does not cease becoming evil, but instead resists the spur.
Quisquis Samsonem considerat et Salomonem,
Whoever considers the cases of Samson and Solomon,
Et reliquos multos mulieris amore sopitos
And the many others brought to eternal rest by love of a woman,
Discet et intendet, mirabitur et reprehendet
Will learn, notice, criticise and marvel at
Exemplis ueris portenta male mulieris.
The real-life precursors of my ‘wicked woman’.
Femina flamma furens, sed flammis acrius urens
Woman, flaming mad, is singed all the more sharply by her own flames.
Totum concussit mundum, succendit, et ussit.
She shakes up the whole world, lights it on fire, and burns it down.
Hec est cunctorum caput, et scintilla malorum,
She is the beginning and spark of all evils,
Orbis que metas semper facit inrequietas.
For she troubles the ends of the earth for eternity.
O mala scintilla: quisquis succenditur illa,
O wicked spark: whoever is set alight by Woman
Ille nec indigne misero consumitur igne,
is deservedly consumed by a wretched fire,
Nec nisi diuina ualet extingui medicina.
which cannot be extinguished unless by some divine remedy.
Haec hominem primum de celso trusit in imum,
It was Woman who first cast Man down from up high,
Intulit et penam mundo, mortisque catenam.
bringing punishment and the chain of death to the world.
Sponsum, serpentem, uitam, genus, Omnipotentem,
She betrayed her husband, welcomed the serpent, spurned life,
Prodidit, admisit, spreuit, uiciauit, omisit.
injured mankind, and lost the All-Powerful.
Et quis eam laudet? Quicquid male cogitat audet,
And who shall praise her? She dares to perform whatever evil she thinks up,
Et cupit expleri rem, qua rea possit haberi.
and yearns to commit some act, so that she will be perceived as guilty.
Nil fugit incestum, cupit omne quod est inhonestum,
In addition, she shuns nothing which is taboo, but wants everything which is dishonourable.
Quicquid agit secum, fas siue nefas, putat equum.
She considers all her plans to be just, whether they be right or wrong.
Femina terrarum confusio, mors animarum,
Woman is the disorder of lands and the death of souls:
Ut mundo late resonet scelerum nouitate,
she is heard far and wide throughout the world due to the strangeness of her sins.
Nil dubium dubitat, nichil euitabile uitat,
She does not doubt that which is doubtful, nor avoid that which is avoidable,
Nil intemptatum sinit, it scelus omne patratum,
but leaves nothing untried, and commits every sin,
Ad causas quasque confundens fasque nefasque.
confusing right and wrong for her own purposes.
Quo magis obscenum scelus est, magis huic fit amenum,
The more obscene a crime is, the more pleasant it seems to her;
Quo magis horrendum, magis hoc putat esse colendum.
the more terrible a sin, the greater the glory she places upon it.
Imperium, sensum, uires, fastidia, censum,
She obtains power, weakens perception, diminishes strength,
Optinet, emollit, minuit, generat, male tollit.
creates annoyance, and exhausts wealth.
Femina tormentum iuuenum, mortis monimentum,
Indeed, Woman is a torment for young men and a reminder of death:
Mortem Samsoni dedit, interitum Salomoni.
she brought about Samson’s demise and Solomon’s end.
Femina priuauit pietatis robore Dauid,
She also deprived David of the strength of his piety,
Quando per inuidiam iugulari fecit Uriam
when he ordered Uriah’s murder out of lustful envy.
Coniuge pro pulchra multi subiere sepulcra.
Many have gone to their graves due to their beautiful wives.
Femina plena malis, faera, pessima, demonialis,
Woman is full of evils, wild, demonic, the worst of all creatures.
Priuauit uita Naboth, pro uitae cupita:
She took away Naboth’s life to obtain his vineyard;
Causa necis subitae sunt res plerumque cupite.
she murders on sudden impulses, and especially out of greed.
Femina mors mundi, mala femina fabula mundi.
Indeed, Woman is the death of the world, and a wicked woman is its scandal.
Exicium, reges, insontes, federa, leges,
She brings destruction, murders kings, slaughters innocents,
Attulit, orbauit, strauit, soluit, uiolauit.
unbinds treaties, and violates laws.
Illa Ioseph iustum Veneris non ignibus ustum,
She saw to it that Joseph, who remained unburnt by the fires of Venus,
Carcere dampnari fecit ferroque ligari.
was condemned to prison and bound in iron chains.
Hec etiam plena rabie truculenta leena
Similarly, that aggressive whore,
Rex ferus artaret uinclis, gladioque necaret,
persuaded the savage king to bind in chains
Fecit ut athletam Domini magnumque prophetam
and kill the champion of the Lord, that great prophet:
Et tulit in disco caput illius, unde tremisco.
then she carried his head on a platter. How I tremble at this!
Fabula Grecorum de libris promit eorum
The books of the Greeks tell of
Quomodo regina Cretensis, lege ferina,
How the Cretan queen,
Carnis ob ardorem nimium, mentisque furorem,
Driven by mental madness and an excess of carnal lust,
Taurum decipit niueum, coituque recepit
Deceived a snow-white bull and copulated with him,
Et peperit natum, taurumque uirumque c[r]eatum:
Eventually giving birth to a son who was half man and half bull.
Turpi nempe nota res est, per secula nota.
This foul deed, which has been passed down through the centuries, is certainly infamous.
Quis non horrescat, quis non horrenda pauescat,
After all, who does not shrink in horror, and fear this repulsive act?
Dum contra legem nature, faemina regem,
That a woman, against the law of nature, should spurn a king
Regem formosum, prudentem, deliciosum
– And no mere king, but handsome, prudent, and pleasant –
Despicit, atque fere succumbit plus muliere?
Only to have sex with a wild beast!
Femina, res fragilis, precio conducta monilis
Woman, a fragile creature, bribed with the price of a necklace,
In populo Danaum, male prodidit Amphiaraum.
Betrayed Amphiaraus to the Greek people.
Sic quoque priuignum uita non funere dignum,
Thus also did Phaedra betray Hippolytus, whom she desired unjustly,
Usque renitentem patriumque cubile uerentem,
And who was worthy of life and not of death,
Prodidit Ypolitum, contra ius Phedra cupitum.
All because he showed reverence for his father’s bed by resisting her advances.
Naso suis libris inscribit quomodo Biblis
Similarly, Naso writes in his books about how Biblis
Igne sit illicito male saucia fratre cupito.
Was badly burnt by an illicit flame while she lusted after her brother.
Fraude quidem mira Cynare coiit sua Myrra,
Deceived in an astounding manner, Cinyras slept with his daughter,
Inque loco [matris] concepit semine [patris].
Who, taking her mother’s place, conceived by the seed of her father.
Scilla patri Niso, fatali crine reciso,
In the same vein, Scylla preferred you, Minos, to her father Nisus;
Pretulit externum regem, regnumque paternum,
She handed her father’s kingdom over to you,
Moinos, concedit tibi, dum fieri tua credit,
As she believed that she would be yours.
Sed detestatus tam diri monstra reatus,
However, detesting the portents of such a dreadful deed,
Et scelus et Scillam metuens, fugis hoc fugis illam.
You avoid both Scylla and her crime, fearing them both.
De multis quandam referam per saecla notandam,
I shall tell of one woman out of many, who must remain infamous throughout the centuries,
Ut relique discant mulieres, atque tremiscant,
So that other women might tremble at her example and learn
Ne poscant supra naturam turpia stupra.
Not to seek foul sex which exceeds the bounds of nature.
Huic fuerat natus, uultu formaque beatus,
This woman would have had a son, blessed in face and figure,
Si non obstaret mala sors, miserumque necaret.
Had evil fate not gotten in the way and killed the poor youth:
Sed serpens ille, qui nos per carmina mille
Yet that serpent, who, through a thousand songs,
Temptat, et intentat, mouet, incitat, atque cruentat,
Tempts, attacks, moves, incites, and pollutes us,
Hunc infelicem mox fecit per genetricem.
Soon brought ruin upon the son through his own mother.
Inquid enim genito genetrix, cupiensque cupito,
Thus she spoke to him,
Inquid Adae seua mulier, simul anguis et Eua:
As the wild woman spoke to Adam, simultaneously both Eve and serpent:
“Te uideo, fili, forma prestare uirili,
“I see that you, my son, stand out with your manly looks:
Exornat uultum sua gratia, gloria cultum.
Your face is graceful and your dress does you honour.
De puero tali, tam pulchro, tam speciali
However, I would rejoice more greatly in such a boy – so beautiful and so special –
Multum gauderem, tibi si plus matre placerem,
If I brought you more pleasure than a mother does,
Aut plus quam natus faceres michi consociatus.
Or if you became more than my son, having joined yourself to me.
Visus formosus, ridens et luxuriosus
Your lovely face, smiling and luxuriant,
Et bene pressa foris labra, dulcis plena saporis,
And your lips, so suited to the shape of your mouth, full of sweet flavour –
Que te condecorant penitus, penitusque decorant,
All these wholly adorn you, indeed they do,
Me nimis incendunt, et me, si uis, tibi uendunt.
And set me exceedingly aflame: if you want me, you can have me.
Quapropter, fili, dum flore nites iuuenili,
Therefore, my son, while you are in the flower of your youth,
Dummodo pubescis, primoque calore rigescis,
While you go through puberty and harden with the first flush of passion,
Ne perdas florem tenerum, tantumque decorem.
Do not waste your tender prime and all this beauty.
Immo sit ad cunctas ueneres tua prona uoluntas:
Instead, incline yourself towards all forms of sexual pleasure,
Canis confaecta celer aduolat, ecce senecta.
For soon grey old age will come upon you.
Tecum non ludemus, sed tristia cuncta feremus.
I am not joking with you, but rather suffering great sorrow at this prospect.
Et quia tiro rudis nescis his ludere ludis
Moreover, since you are but a young initiate, and do not know how to play the games
Quos amat ipsa Venus et Amor persuadet amenus,
Which Venus herself loves and pleasant Love suggests,
Tantum consenti michi, tantum crede docenti:
Simply agree to my proposition and trust in my teaching.
Illos complebo tecum, iamiamque docebo.
I will explore these games with you, teaching you to play again and again.
Ergo meis pare uotis, michi consociare,
Hence, obey my wishes, join yourself to me:
Quicquid agis meum celabo, con[s]cia tecum.”
As your accomplice, I shall keep secret all that you do with me.”
Tandem turbatus materno famine natus,
Disturbed by his mother’s speech, the son
Heret, miratur, stupet, et quid agat meditatur,
Was lost for words. Flabbergasted and shocked, he thought of what he should do in response.
Speque bona fortis lacrimis ita fatur abortis:
Eventually, he spoke thus, shedding wasted tears in good faith:
“Cara parens, pietate carens, miranda fateris,
“Dear mother, you lack piety in speaking of such unusual matters:
Criminibus mirabilibus nos perdere queris.
You seek to destroy us with these astounding crimes.
Quod loqueris suadet Venus puer ipse Cupido
What you said must have been inspired by Cupid himself, Venus’ son,
Quo regitur, quo dirigitur mala cuique libido.
Who controls and directs each person’s wicked lust.
Non ualeo, prohibente Deo, tibi consociari
I am not able to join myself to you in marriage, since God prohibits it;
Coniugio, sed amore pio uolo castus amari.
Instead, I wish to love you chastely, with a pious love.
Cognita namque satis series cumsanguinitatis
Our biological bond
Hoc scelus accusat graviter, fierique recusat.
Heavily condemns this crime and forbids it from happening;
Hinc gladius regis furit, hinc sententia legis,
For if it were to take place, the sword of the King would rage against us, as would the sentence of His law:
Cui nichil occultum, cui nullum crimen inultum.
Nothing is hidden from Him, and no crime goes unpunished.
Mater amabilis, insuperabilis, ad meliora
My beloved and irreplaceable mother,
Te precor erige factaque corrige deteriora.
I beg you to devote yourself to better deeds and correct your mistakes.
Te Venus horrida flammaque torrida ledit amoris,
Although terrible Venus has struck you with the torrid flame of desire
Vince uiriliter et iace fortiter arma pudoris.
Nevertheless conquer it bravely and fight back strongly with the weapons of modesty.
Tela cupidinis atque libidinis ignea frange,
Break down the spears of desire and the fires of lust:
Percute pectora, perdita tempora, uel modo plange.
Beat your breast and your wretched face,
Stupra, negocia carnis, et ocia uana tremisce,
You should tremble at illicit sex, carnal intercourse, and vain leisure,
Spiritualia, perpetualia, cuncta cupisce.
And instead long for things which are spiritual, perpetual, and whole.
Suspice sidera, mater, et infera sperne deorsum,
Look at the stars, mother, and spurn whatever is below:
Queque labencia uel moriencia linque retrorsum.
Leave behind all these earthly impulses while they fall and die.
Scilicet omnia, sunt quasi somnia sunt fugitiva,
All of these are like fleeting dreams;
Lapsaque tempore, sunt sine robore, non rediuiua.”
Lacking strength, they melt away with time and do not return again.”
Mater ad haec dicta, uelut ictu fulminis icta
Upon hearing these words, the mother was as if struck by a bolt of lightning:
Pallet, tabescit, quasi cera sub igne liquescit.
She grew pale, drooped, and melted like wax under a flame.
Defectu mentis, penitus ratione carentis,
Due to her weakness of mind and complete lack of reason,
Quod uidet offensam se, quod grauiter reprehensam,
She felt offended and saw that she had been severely reprehended
Quod castigatur, quod casta manere rogatur.
And criticised. Moreover, she perceived that she was being asked to remain chaste.
Et, licet ingratum sibi senciat hac uice natum,
Although this outcome diminished her affection towards her son,
Non tamen errori caedit, ceptoque furori,
She did not give in to error and carry out her insane plan.
Hunc sed in occulto male saucia tempore multo
Instead, she spent a long time nursing her wounds in secret,
Impetit, insequitur, nec eo pro uelle potitur,
All the while seeking her son and making advances on him, whom she was nevertheless unable to obtain according to her wishes.
Fertque graues penas, Veneris nec stringit habenas,
She suffered heavy penalties and failed to control her desire,
Dumque reluctatur Veneri, luctando grauatur.
But rather felt herself to be all the more burdened while fighting against it.
Nec sua compescit mala, sed magis acta calescit,
Moreover, she did not put an end to her evils, but rather grew hotter as she acted:
At postquam cernit quia filius hanc male spernit,
After she saw that her son wholly despised her lust,
Quod pereunt uerba, perit et sua messis in herba,
As evidenced by her wasted words and her inability to harvest the fruits of her labour,
Fraudibus armatur, studet ut iuuenis perimatur.
She girt herself with treachery and tried to destroy the young man.
Hac igitur causa, maius scelus ob scelus ausa,
Consequently, driven to greater audacity by her existing crimes,
Iudicis ad sedem currit, flens introit edem.
She ran into the courthouse and entered it while weeping.
Accusat natum, iacit in quem dira reatum,
She accused her son and brought dreadful charges against him,
Dicens: “Huc, patres, oculos huc uertite, matres,
Saying: “Look here, fathers, mothers,
Vosque, pii nati, patribus bene semper amati,
And you, good beloved sons,
Quos non incestus Veneris contaminat aestus,
Whom the incestuous heat
Currite, deflete mecum, dampnate, dolete.
Run to my side, cry with me, curse my son, and feel my pain.
Dedecus illatum michi, monstriferumque reatum.
I am the victim of an indignity and a monstrous crime.
Rem referam fedam, pudet edere, sed tamen edam,
It shames me to tell you about this sordid matter, but nevertheless I shall speak.
Vnde querar refero, minor est, querimonia uero.
I barely know how to begin my complaint, but here it is.
Est puer insanus michi, lubricus, atque prophanus,
I have a demented son who is lustful and profane.
Quem peperisse pudet me, cum mea turpia nudet,
I am ashamed of having given birth to him, since he strips me naked;
Quem doleo natum, male cum uideam fatuatum.
Oh, how I regret that he was born, since I see that he has gone thoroughly mad.
Hic pecudum more, materno captus amore,
He is a beast; captured by love for his own mother,
Cum male seuiret nuper, matremque nequiret
He has been acting savagely towards me. Since he could not win his mother over
Donis oblatis, precibus quoque multiplicatis,
Through gifts and unceasing entreaties,
Vincere, luctantis contra, stuprumque negantis
While I fought against him and turned my face from his lust
Ora, cruentauit manibus, uestes lacerauit,
He befouled me with his hands, tore my clothes apart,
Sic et sic egit, sic me ferus ille subegit,
Did this and that, and pushed me down – the beast! – like this,
Non tamen oppressit, quia me clamante recessit.
But he did not possess me, for I shouted and forced him to retreat.
Ergo Deo gratus iudex prudensque senatus,
May the judge, upon whom God smiles, and the wise assembly
Pertractent secum quid sit de talibus aequum.
Determine among themselves a proportionate penalty for these acts:
Quorum censura pollent ciuilia iura,
After all, it is their judgement which grants the law its power,
Per quos maiorem res publica sumpsit honorem.
And it is through them that the city gains greater honour.
Patrum magestas uilescit et urbis honestas,
The majesty of the elders and the honour of the city
Ni melioratae fuerint cause uiciate.
Will be cheapened, unless injured parties receive amends.
Non uni tantum fit dedecus hoc michi: quantum
This disgrace does not affect me alone, but
Innumeris turbis, que presunt menibus urbis.
Taints all the uncountable crowds who flock to the walls of this city.
Nulla mei pietas nati, non forma, uel etas.
My son has neither piety nor good looks, nor does his age excuse him.
Quamlibet aetatem moueat, precor, ad pietatem,
Even though he might use that excuse to win your mercy,
Stupra sed obscena compescant uindice pena,
I urge you all, whether great or small, whether young or old,
Parui, maiores, iuuenes simul, et seniores.”
To check these foul crimes of lust with a vengeful penalty.” 
Sic accusatus puer, et mox ante uocatus
Thus the youth, who had been summoned a short while ago, found himself accused.
Audit clamorem matris, lesumque pudorem.
He heard his mother’s cries and perceived her lack of modesty.
Stat, silet ad uerba nec acerbis reddit acerba,
He stood in silence, and did not counter her bitter words with his own.
Immo uerecundus, lacrimabilis et pudibundus
Instead, he behaved in a reverent, doleful, and modest manner,
Vultum preclarum riuis rorat lacrimarum,
Inundating his most handsome face with rivers of tears.
Seque reum pingit, et vultum crimine tinguit,
He portrayed himself as the guilty party and tainted his own face with the charge,
Malens torqueri, quam matris probra fateri,
For he preferred to undergo torture rather than to speak ill of his mother,
Malens dampnari, quam crimine commaculari.
And to suffer condemnation rather than to be stained with such an offence.
Cumque diu fleret suspirans, atque doleret
He wept for a long time, sighing all the while, equally troubled
Tam matris sortem, quam uicinam sibi mortem,
By his mother’s eternal fate and his own approaching death.
Protinus, allatis annalibus et recitatis,
The legal records of the city were brought in and read out loud.
Pena reperta datur, ut in amnem proiciatur.
A suitable punishment was found for the crime: the offender was to be thrown into the river.
Ergo miser tandem mortem subiturus eandem,
As both the judge and the mother urged the crowd on,
Iudicis urgente monitu, genetrice petente,
They seized, dragged, grabbed, and scratched
Vndique raptatur, trahitur, premitur, laceratur.
The poor youth who was about to suffer this very death.
Et sic dampnatus, postremo precipitatus
Thus condemned, he was finally thrown
Gurgitis in fundum, subiit baptisma secundum.
Into the bottom of the river and underwent a second baptism.
At scelus occultum tandem non cessit inultum.
However, the mother’s hidden crime did not go unpunished.
Nam scelerum uindex Dominus, iusti pius index,
The Lord, who takes vengeance for sins and bears pious witness on behalf of the just,
Vt foret incaestus matris populo manifestus,
Revealed her incest to the people.
Fulminibus crebris missis, ortisque tenebris,
Sending down torrents of lightning and raising up the shadows,
Vrbem, carnificem, puerum, pueri genetricem,
He incinerated the city, thwarted the executioner,
Vssit, turbauit, saluauit, dilacerauit.
Saved the youth, and tore the mother into pieces.
O nimium fortis mala femina, femina mortis,
O wicked and over-impudent woman – woman of death indeed –
Eligit ante mori, quam stulto cedat amori.
Who chose to die instead of giving up her fatuous love!
Mauult sectari stuprum, quam casta beari,
She preferred to seek out illicit sex rather than to be praised for chastity,
Mauult ulcisci male, quam mater pia dici.
And to be punished severely instead of being praised as a pious mother.
Infelix mater, mala mater, nec modo mater,
Wretched mother, wicked mother, and not even a true mother:
Quam, quoniam natum male perdidit amne necatum,
Having drowned her own son,
Suppliciis dignis, celestis torruit ignis.
She burned with the just punishment of celestial fire.
Femina terribilis draco, trux lupa, bestia uilis.
Woman is a terrible serpent,
Cum tristis diram leuiter prorumpit in iram,
That miserable creature bursts into fatal rage at the smallest provocation,
Non cito pacatur, non ante reconciliatur
And cannot be appeased quickly; on the contrary, she is never reconciled
Quam paena multa, sibi uis illata, sit ulta.
Until she has avenged herself through violence.
Hanc si ludentem male, uerbaque uana loquentem
If her husband should, on some occasion, restrain her with a sharp scolding
Eius uir uerbis aliquando cohercet acerbis,
From clowning around and babbling vain words,
Siue leui terret uirga, ne turpiter erret,
Or even deter her from committing foul misdeeds with a stick,
Ilico facta dolens, et ei succumbere nolens,
She will henceforth take offence and refuse to sleep with him.
Plorat, tristatur, suspiria dat, meditatur,
She will cry, upset herself, sigh, and think of
Qualiter ut uita careat, paret huic achonita.
How to deprive him of his life. To this end she will prepare him some monkshood.
Tandem serpentum quesita uenena nocentum
Indeed, having obtained the venom of poisonous snakes
Necnon herbarum uirus graue mortiferarum
And the deadly toxin of death-bringing plants,
Conficit in potum, complens de coniuge uotum.
She will mix them into a drink and thus fulfill her plan against her husband.
Hoc ita sublato sponso, uix et tumulato,
Even while he is still warm in his grave,
Post malefictarum teneros questus lacrimarum,
She will put on tender displays of crocodile tears,
Coniuncx quesiti subito cupit esse mariti,
And seek to become another man’s wife.
Et uelut inuita negat hoc prius, usque petita.
However, she will feign unwillingness until she obtains a strong suit;
Ast ubi suadentum rem, perstat cura parentum,
Then, when her parents insist on the marriage
Nec contradici debere fatentur amici,
And her friends persuade her not to refuse him,
Laeticiae plenas uotorum laxat habenas,
She will gladly give in to happiness
Menteque iocunda, sponso sit sponsa secula.
And transform herself into a worldly wife for her new husband
Quodque propinauit primo, quem perfida strauit,
Yet if he proves difficult, he will drink the same potion
Si sit uir durus, erit alter idem bibiturus.
That she served her first husband, whom she treacherously murdered.
Femina formosa nimis esset res preciosa,
A beautiful woman is precious beyond all description
Si male nil cuperet, si sponso fida maneret.
If she has no bad intentions and remains faithful to her husband,
Sed, quod abhorrendum nimis est cunctisque pudendum,
But it should be a source of horror and shame to all women
Vix habet ulla fidem, qua credi possit eidem.
That none of them can be trusted.
Que quo diligitur magis, hoc grauior reperitur,
The more a woman is loved, the more troublesome she becomes;
Quo magis ornatur, magis inde superba notatur.
Similarly, she grows all the more arrogant as a result of rich ornaments.
Nescit maiorem, nescit se ferre minorem,
As a result, she does not recognise her superior, nor does she fulfill her inferior role in an appropriate manner.
Par
Although she is joined to an equal in marriage, she wants to take an unequal share of power.
Res optatiua nimis est, animeque nociua.
Woman is too desirable and thus harms the soul.
Illius uultus, bene conditus, et bene cultus,
Through her well-formed and well-groomed face,
Allicit, innectit iuuenes, sua sub iuga flectit
She attracts and ensnares young men; she enslaves them
Apte ludendo, psallendo, uana loquendo.
By playing games, performing music, and chatting about empty matters.
Que dum spectari, dum se presentit amari,
When she perceives that she is being watched and admired,
Querit maiorem membris augere decorem.
She seeks to enhance her physical beauty:
Tunc pingit uisum gratum, format bene risum,
Consequently, she paints her face beautifully, sets her mouth into a smile,
Vestibus ornatur nitidis, gemmis honeratur,
Dresses herself in shining garments, and weighs herself down with jewels
Floribus innectit crines, et se bene pectit,
She weaves flowers into her hair and arranges it in a becoming manner,
Stricta succiungit se zona, basia fingit
And also girds herself with a tightened belt. She performs the sort of kisses
Qualia uelle putat iuuenes, iuuenesque salutat,
Which she expects will please young men, 
Fertque manu flores, et dulces cantat amores.
Carries flowers in her hands, and sings about sweet romance.
Si uero nescit cantare, loquendo capescit
However, even if she cannot sing, she uses her speech
Cor auditoris, quod uulnere languet amoris,
To capture her listener’s heart, which throbs with the wound of love.
Factaque uenalis, uenatio demonialis,
Selling herself to him, hunting him like a demon,
Prostat, ut incaestum querat de corpore questum.
She incites him into seeking illicit pleasure from her body.
Iupiter
Some Jupiter, armed with his impure gaze,
Sic incedentem, iuuenes sic allicientem,
Sees her behaving in this manner and attracting young men;
Vultu candenti nitidam, cultuque decenti,
He notices the shine of her pale face and her decorous dress.
Eius uexatur mox ignibus, et meditatur:
Immediately, he feels himself singed by fire, and considers
Qualiter hanc Ledam celerem faciat sibi predam,
How he should quickly take possession of this new Leda.
Quam prece pretemptat, donis persepe frequentat,
He seduces her with entreaties and showers her in gifts,
Vt sua postposito uelit esse puella marito.
So that she might give herself to him behind her husband’s back.
Sed male securus coniuncx de coniuge durus,
Nevertheless, her strict husband begins to feel insecure,
Quam sic prostantem, sic cernit ubique uagantem,
As he sees her offering herself freely and wandering all about.
Arguit etatem teneram, puerae leuitatem,
On account of her young age and her youthful levity,
Inque domo, tenere flentem cogit residere,
He forces his tearful wife to stay at home.
Vallatamque seris, custodibus atque seueris,
He walls her in with lock and key and assigns her care to austere guards,
Non sinit exire thalamis, ludosque subire.
Forbidding her from leaving the marital home and entering into her usual games.
Quam quia custodit, non diligit ille sed odit,
However, because he guards her, he ceases to love her:
Odit et infestat, et ut hec sit adultera prestat.
Instead he hates her and attacks her, treating her as an adulteress.
Cui custos durus nequid aut obsistere murus,
In any case, nothing - not a strict guard, not walls,
Non iugis pena, sed nec sera, siue catena,
Not punishments, bars, or chains -
Quin faciat secum, si uult, colludere mechum.
Can stop her from taking on a lover:
O male seruatus thesaurus sic uiolatus,
O badly-preserved treasure, thus violated,
Qui dum seruatur, furem uocat ut rapiatur.
Which encourages a thief to steal it even while it is being guarded!
Atque quod obscenum nimis est, querens alienum,
What is more, it is extremely obscene that a wife, while seeking another man,
Sponsa suum prodit sponsum, contempnit et odit.
Should betray, despise, and hate her own husband.
Ergo monstriferae metuens, homo, dampna Chimere,
Therefore, reader, fearing the injuries of that monstrous Chimera,
Sis exemplorum memor hic tibi propositorum;
Keep the aforementioned examples in mind.
Nuptas matronas, ad plurima crimina pronas
Remember to avoid married women, who are given to many offences,
Donaque prebentes uiduas, in amore furentes,
As well as love-crazed widows offering gifts.
Necnon uirgineas uitare memento choreas,
Leave dancing maidens alone,
Illarum mammas teneras fugiens quasi flammas.
And flee their tender breasts as if they were made of flame.
Hostibus his ternis, ut prescriptum bene cernis,
These three types of foes – as the preceding verses indicate –
Incentiuorum crescunt fomenta malorum.
Incite and encourage the growth of many evils.
Has fuge serpentes uirus letale uomentes,
Avoid therefore these serpents who spit out fatal venom,
Has hostes uita, ne te fugiat tua uita.
And flee these enemies, lest you should lose your life.
Claustra tue mentis signato meis documentis,
Seal the gates of your mind with my examples,
Ne liget illecebris uariis te fraus muliebris.
So that you will not find yourself entangled by the various traps of female deceit.
Quem semel illa ligat, curis sine fine fatigat,
Once a woman has trapped a man, she will harass him with unending cares;
Quem sub se flectit, seruili compede nectit.
Once she has forced him into subservience, she will shackle him into servitude.
Res ita plena dolis non est sub sidere solis
There is nothing at all under the sun which is more filled with tricks
Rebus in innumeris, uelut est animus mulieris.
Than the soul of Woman.
O quam fallaci modulo studioque sagaci,
O, with such cunning means and keen enthusiasm
Stultos comprendit iuuenes ubi retia tendit!
Does she seize foolish youths and scoop them up in her net!
Fraudis multimodos uersuto pectore nodos
In her trickery, she twists knots of all kinds within her chest,
Voluit, et euoluit, soluit, ligat atque resoluit,
Untwists them, unties them, ties them again, then once more unties them:
Vt male seducat miseros, et ad infera ducat.
She does all this in order to seduce wretched souls and lead them to Hell.
Quisquis ei cedit, nec ab eius amore recedit,
Therefore, whoever yields to Woman and does not give up his love
Tandem falletur, tandem laqueo capietur;
Will find himself deceived and caught in a noose.
Cuius amor, uisus, caro mollis, basia, risus,
The love, sight, soft flesh, kisses, smiles,
Alloquium, tactus, uariique libidinis actus,
Conversation, touch, lustful acts,
Vox etiam lena, laqueus sunt atque catena,
And whorish voice of Woman are all nooses, chains,
Et graue tormentum quorumlibet insipientum.
And heavy torments for the unwise.
Felix est supere quisquis ualet ista cauere,
He who can avoid these things is truly fortunate;
Quem non haec tangit contagio, non furor angit.
For madness does not disturb the man who remains uncontaminated by Woman.
Hic infelicem probo quisquis amat meretricem,
I say truly, whoever loves a whore is most unfortunate indeed;
Cuius amor dirus, tandem pungens quasi uirus,
For her love is fatal and stings like venom,
Sub specie mellis distillat pocula fellis,
And she prepares a cup of bitterness in the guise of honey.
Cuius amor nex est, caro uermis, gloria fex est,
Her love is a chain, her flesh is vermin, her glory comprises the dregs of the earth;
Verba, lenis uentus, fumus decor, umbra iuventus.
Her words are a soft breeze, and yet her smokescreen of beauty is but the shadow of youth.
Iam calamo fesso, que sit mala femina cesso
My pen is exhausted;
Scribere. Quod scripsi minus est quam congruit ipsi.
Nevertheless, what I have managed to set down falls far short of Woman’s fair share of censure.
Si michi Nasonis, si detur lingua Catonis,
Even if I should receive the tongue of Ovid or that of Cato,
Claraque linguarum facundia magniloquarum,
And the famed skill of linguistic eloquence,
Non tamen exsoluo uerbis, scriptisque reuoluo,
I would not be able to outline in words or describe in my verses
Quam sit uersuta, quam perfida, quam sit acuta,
How wily, treacherous, keen,
Quam sit dampnosa mala femina, quamue dolosa.
Dangerous, and sneaky a wicked woman is.
Nesciat hoc nemo, quod carmine signo supremo:
Let no one be unaware of the following truth, with which I shall round off my poem:
Femina rara bona, sed que bona digna corona.
‘Rarely is a woman good, but a good woman is worthy of a crown.’

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The <em>De Muliere Mala</em> was first compiled in the <em>Liber Floridus</em>, an 1120 encyclopedia containing what Lambert, a later canon of Saint Omer, considered to be the most important knowledge in his possession. The “autograph copy,” written in Lambert’s own hand, is currently stored in the Ghent University Library as MS 92. The manuscript includes other Pictor poems, for example a satire on money narrated by the personified <em>Denarius</em> (“Dollar”). The fact that Pictor’s work was deliberately excerpted for inclusion in this collection, alongside more well-known texts such as Isidore’s <em>Etymologiae</em>, indicates that contemporaries appreciated its literary and moral value. While there are no exact duplicates, dozens of partial copies survive, including the twelfth-century French manuscript upon which this edition is based. Their proliferation suggests that Petrus Pictor, and by extension the <em>De Muliere Mala</em>, were frequently read in medieval European monasteries.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Petrus Pictor, a canon (resident clergyman) at Saint-Omer in northern France, composed <em>De Muliere Mala</em> (“The Wicked Woman”) in the late eleventh or early twelfth century. In his poem, Pictor first cites a litany of historical and biblical examples on the evil of womankind before detailing the fatal vengeance of a rebuffed mother-seducer who falsely accuses her own son of rape. <em>De Muliere Mala</em> thus participates in a long tradition of misogynistic Christian writing as embodied by Tertullian, a pioneering theologian from the second and third centuries AD, who interpreted Eve’s fall from grace as a warning that women are “the Devil’s gateway” (<em>De Habitu Mulierum</em> 1.1). Nevertheless, it is far more than a mere moralising text, for its explicit treatment of incestuous lust looks to Classical models: Pictor accords a literary status to his verses by referencing ancient erotic writers such as Ovid (43BC-17/18AD) and Apuleius (c. 124-170 AD). The rhetoric of the poem is reinforced by its aggressive anaphoras (repeated phrases at the beginnings of certain lines) and pounding polysyndetons (lists of words linked only by conjunctions, typically “and...and”), which simultaneously drive home the notion that all women are malicious and evoke the eponymous Wicked Woman’s uncontrollable frenzy. Owing to these complex layers, this rarely-studied poem has the potential to please a diverse crowd. It is especially interesting to consider its portrayal of sexual aggression in the light of current debates on this topic, and to question its support of gender essentialism, that is, the notion that all women share the same malevolent characteristics. The poem is, moreover, an enjoyable read as it constitutes a thrilling psychological portrait on the extremities to which lust and pride can lead.</p>
