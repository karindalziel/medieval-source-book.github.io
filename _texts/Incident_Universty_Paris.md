    Facta congregacione Universitatis apud Sanctum Bernardum die secunda mensis Januarii super duobus articulis. On the second day of the month of January, the university congregation met at the Collège des Bernardins to discuss two matters. Primus erat ad reparandum et reformandum casum instum enormem, qui accidit inter illud collegium notabile Harricurie et magistrum domus Chirene in vico Cythare The first one was the reparation and rectification of the outrageous incident which had occurred between the illustrious Collège d’Harcourt and the master of the Chirene house in rue de la Harpe. qui casus habuit ortum de uno equo mortuo ducto a domo illius domus predicte usque ad hostium dicti venerabilis collegii,   According to public knowledge, the incident originated around a dead horse brought from the house of the master of the said house to the entrance of the distinguished Collège. […]  secundum quo omnibus erat notum. […] Et ut in posterum remaneat in memoria hominum, casus erat iste. The facts of the incident are reported here, so that they might remain in the memory of men in the future. Erat quidam equus ductus de domo Chirenis predicta, et postquam venerat ante portam collegii venerabilis Harricurie, predictus equus remansit mortuus, A certain horse was conducted out of the Chirene house, and when it arrived in front of the door of the distinguished Collège d’Harcourt, it died;  et qui primo ducebat equum, dimittendo equum ivit ad domum suam. the person who was at first leading the horse went back to their house leaving the horse behind.  Postquam magistri et scolares collegii predicti perceperant illud cadavar fore ante hostium ipsorum, et perceperant quod venerat de domo Chirenis, et istud erat circa horam sextam post vesperas: After vespers, at around six o’clock, the masters and students of the Collège noticed the carcass in front of their entrance door, and realised that it came from the Chirene house. duo vel tres scolares ibant de collegio predicto usque ad domum predictam et instabant circa hospitem domus, ut removeret istud cadavar de collegio ipsorum. Two or three students then went from the Collège to the said house and pressed its host for the removal of the carcass from their Collège.  Primo respondebat: byen, tantoct. Isti scolares recesserunt, et post septimam, postquam nullum viderant qui ammoveret illud cadavar, ipsi scolares iterato adibant domum predictam et instabant secundum quod prius.  At first, the host replied: Well, immediately. The students withdrew, and after seven o’clock, when they had not seen anyone moving the carcass, they went to the house a second time and repeated their request.  Et respondebat iste dominus de Chirenis scolaribus valde perverse isto modo scilicet:  And the master of the Chirene house replied to the students in this extremely wicked way: "Et quomodo, domini mei, equus exivit vivus de domo mea, et quomodo potest esse mortuus ante domum vestram, multum miror; "My lords, I am greatly surprised at how it is possible that the horse left my house alive and is now dead in front of yours. est ibi, dicit ipse, ymago nostre Domine super hostium vestrum; credo vere quod equus fecit sibi reverenciam, sicud in nocte Nativitatis bos et azinus. There is an image of our Lord above your door; I sincerely believe that the horse was just paying reverence to it, like the ox and the donkey on the night of the Nativity.  Ay, domini mei, levetis caudam equi et respiciatis in culo, bene videbitis utrum ne vivat, et eciam respiciatis in ore; vere non potest esse mortuus. Yes, my lords, if you lift the tail of the horse and look in its ass, you will clearly see whether it is dead, and look in its mouth too; it truly cannot be dead.  Bene scio quod vivit." I know very well that it is alive." Et ista responsio videbatur multum proterva illis scolaribus abeuntibus, [qui] traxerunt equum de collegio, unus per caudam, alter per pedes, etc., usque ad domum Chyrenis, et vocando hospitem dixerunt: This reply seemed very wicked to the students as they were walking off, and they therefore dragged the horse from the Collège all the way to the Chirene house, one by its tail, one by its hoof, etc., and as a way of summoning the host said:  "Ecce nos, Malgeti, respiciatis equum vestrum". "Here we are, Malgeti, look at your horse." Et quibusdam intrantibus domum clausa fuit janua, et infra limen et hostium domus remansit pes unius scolarium, et fortiter clamabat. And while they were entering the house, the portal was closed, and the foot of a student  remained stuck between the street and the door, and he was loudly screaming. Alii illud videntes tantum fecerunt, quod hostium aperiebatur, et recesserunt ad collegium.  Seeing this, the others managed to have the door reopened, and the students withdrew to the Collège.  Deinde circa duodecimam horam, omnibus quasi existentibus in lecto, venit hospes Chyrenis cum aliquibus aliis, scilicet duobus militibus hospitibus in domo sua, et clamabant ad adjutorium regis:  Afterwards, at around midnight, when almost everybody was in their bed, the host of the Chirene house arrived with some others, certainly with two soldiers who were guests in his house, and they were crying for royal support: "Ecce istos Normanos de collegio Harricurie, qui sunt traditores regis et regni et duci Burgundie!" "Behold, the Normans of the Collège d’Harcourt, who are traitors to the King, the Kingdom, and the Duke of Burgundy!" Et secundum statuta burgensium quilibet posuit se in armis, et veniens ante collegium quilibet clamabat: And according to the statutes, every burgher armed himself, and going before the Collège was screaming:  "frangatis hostia et muros" etc., et erant bene in numero armati CCC ante collegium illud, et fregerunt hostia et intraverunt clamantes "ad mortem", "let’s break the doors and the walls" etc., and then there were three hundred well-armed people before the Collège, and they shattered the doors and entered shouting "to death", et fregerunt bene viginti januas camerarum, et nullum reperiebant armatum in dicto collegio, […] et clamabant: "Ponamus ignem!"  and very much destroyed twenty room doors, although they could not find anyone who was armed in the Collège, […] and were shouting: "Set fire!"  Et tunc veniebat prepositus Parysiensis et omnia disposuit ad melius. Then the provost of Paris arrived and redressed the situation. Et erant duo scolares de domo capti et duo fortiter volnerati.  And two students were seized from the house, and two others were severely injured. Et iste est casus de quo prius tangebatur, quem in plena congregacione narraverunt duo magistri in theologya de collegio.  This is the incident which has been previously touched upon, which two masters in Theology from the Collège recounted before the entire congregation. Et concludebat nacio, quod iste hospes detineretur in carceribus, quousque nobis fieret emenda condigna. And the nation concluded that the host would have been detained in prison until an appropriate compensation had been made to us.

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>Medieval European universities were often organized into a variable number of ‘Nations’ (<em>nationes</em>), semi-independent associations which grouped together students and masters on a broadly geographical basis. The University of Paris had four Nations: the French, the Picard, the Norman, and the English/German one. Compiled by the proctors (elective officials) of the Nations, the ‘books of the proctors of the Nations’ <em>(libri procuratorum nationis</em>) were registers containing chronological entries which documented any significant information about the academic, social, and political life of each Nation and of the university in general. Needless to say, these are sources of unparalleled value when studying early universities. The original manuscripts of the English/German Nation, which survive for most of the 14th and 15th centuries, are currently kept at the Bibliothèque de la Sorbonne in Paris; the manuscript to which the passage belongs is Reg. 5 (fols. 50r-v).</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Composed in Paris in early 1413, this Latin passage comes from a book of the proctors of the English/German Nation at the medieval University of Paris. Its author is Johannes de Reno, a master of the University, who was proctor of the Nation at the time. The writing style is simple and almost rushed, reflecting the practical character of the books of the proctors (more on this below). The passage recounts the events surrounding a curious incident which occurred between the scholars of the Collège d’Harcourt and the host of a nearby Parisian lodging house in late 1412. After one of the horses of the lodging house is found dead in front of the Collège, some students repeatedly visit the house and ask for the carcass to be removed, but to no avail; the host even directs ridiculing and vulgar words at them. The angry students therefore drag the carcass back to the lodging house themselves. Later, in the middle of the night, some of the guests of the house and other Parisian burghers attack the Collège, and an extremely violent fight ensues; the situation is partially redressed only through the intervention of the Provost. The passage is interesting because it does not only exemplify the adversarial relationship between ‘town’ and ‘gown’, i.e. local residents and members of the university community, in a town such as Paris, but it can also be useful to observe the impact of current political developments on the university community. The passage can in fact be situated in the context of the Hundred Years’ War and the Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War: in their attack to the Collège, the guests of the lodging house appear to have been motivated by political revenge against its Norman residents, as Normandy had proven to be a troublesome region during the preceding years of war.</p>
