## Introduction to the Source 
<p>Eighty-eight similar <em>Somniale Ioseph</em> texts survive in manuscript editions, most from the fifteenth century. This particular copy was written in the thirteenth century in Venice or the Veneto and is preserved in<a href="https://digital.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/werkansicht?PPN=PPN679690611&view=overview-toc&PHYSID=PHYS_0106&DMDID=DMDLOG_0006"> Berlin in Staatsbibliothek, Preußischer Kulturbesitz, MS Ham. 390 f.49v</a> alongside another the mantic alphabet published on the <em>GMS </em>as well as other divinatory and oracular texts.</p> <p>Below the alphabet on the page an illustrator has included a kind of diagram of how the dreambook functions. A small figure is shown asleep and dreaming (labeled <em>iste dormit</em>) and then is shown sitting awake before a group of friends as he excitedly explains his dream with the help of a book open on his lap (labeled <em>hic splanat somnia</em>).</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-33ca8981-7fff-1a21-0764-12f4073cef22">This short text is one of many so-called “dreambooks” - personal guides to dream interpretation - that flourished across Europe and Byzantium in the late Middle Ages. This particular example is a mantic alphabet known as a <em>Somniale Ioseph</em>, named for Joseph, the Old Testament dream interpreter. Like a similar mantic alphabet contained in the same manuscript and <a href="https://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/explanation-divination-through-apostles">also published on the GMS</a>, it is designed to be used alongside another text. A dreamer opens a book, often a psalter or prayer book, at random and stops at the first letter that they see. Turning back to the Somniale Ioseph, then, the dreamer reads the entry corresponding to that letter.</p> <p dir="ltr">This text differs from other kinds of alphabetical dreambooks, such as the tradition known as Somniale Danielis, which listed themes and images from dreams alongside interpretations. This text instead introduces a note of chance, drawing on the long history of bibliomancy (fortune-telling with books) in the Middle Ages.</p> <p dir="ltr">Dream interpretation was a popular pastime in the Middle Ages and hundreds of manuscript copies of dreambooks, drawn from Arabic, Byzantine, Greek, and Hebrew sources, survive alongside those written in Latin and vernacular European languages.</p>
