Passando por la Toscana,
Traveling through Tuscany,
entre Sena et Florencia,
between Siena and Florence,
vi dama gentil galana
I saw an elegant gentle lady
digna de grand reuerencia.
Worthy of great reverence.
Cara tenia de romana,
She had the face of a Roman,
tocadura purtoguesa,
A Portuguese headdress,
el ayre de castellana,
And air of a Castilian,
vestida como senesa
Was dressed like a Sienese,
discretamente, non uana;
Discreetly, not vain;
yo le fise reuerencia
I bowed to her
y ella, con mucha prudencia,
And she, very cautiously, 
bien mostro ser cortesana.
Did prove to be courteous.
Assy entramos por Sena,
That is how we entered Siena
fablando de compannia,
Conversing in company
con plaser auiendo pena
With pleasure and sorrow
del pesar que me plasia.
For a grief that pleased me.
Sy se dilatara el dia
If the day had been extended
o la noche nos tomara,
Or the night had arrived,
tan grand fuego se encendia
Such great fire would have been ignited
que toda la tierra quemara.
That it would have burned the earth out.
Vestia de blancho domasquino,
Dressed in white damask,
camurra al touillo cortada,
Gamurra cut at the ankle
ençima de un uelud fino
Over a fine velvet,
un luto la falda rastrada;
A mourning skirt down to the floor;
ponposa et agraciada,
Pompous and graceful,
una inuencion traya
A verse she carried with her
por letras que non entendia,
With letters she did not understand,
de perlas la manga bordada.
On the sleeves embroidered with pearls.
Item mas, traya un ioyel
In addition, she wore a little jewel
de richas piedras pesantes,
Of rich heavy stones,
un balax y entorno d’el
A purple spinel and, around it,
çafis, rubis et dyamantes
Sapphires, rubies, and diamonds
firmando sobre la fruente
Fixed on her forehead
con muy grande resplandor,
With such a great glow;
pero dauale el fauor
But what favored her the most
Su gesto lyndo, plasiente.
Was her pleasant, beautiful countenance.
En su fabla, uestir et ser
In her speech, dress, and demeanor
non mostraua ser de mandra.
She did not appear to be rustic,
Queriendo su nonbre saber,
Wanting to know her name
respondiome que Casandra.
She told me it was Casandra.
Yo con tal nonbre oyr
At just hearing such a name,
muy alegre desperte
I woke up much delighted.
e tan solo me falle
And I found myself so lonely
que por Dios pense morir.
That by god I thought I would die.

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The poem is copied in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, VITR/17/7, fol. 153r-154r. This manuscript is a copy of the poetry collection known as the Cancionero de Estúñiga, ca. 1465. It has been digitized: <a href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837">http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837</a>. It contains a compilation of mostly Castilian poems, including ballads, as well as a few Italian compositions. Their authors attended the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous, in Naples in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This poem is a <em>serranilla</em>, an evolution of the Provençal <em>pastorela</em>. Written in short verse (<em>arte menor</em>), <em>serranillas</em> narrate a courtly poet’s encounter with a mountain woman. This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous <em>serranillas</em>, Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this poem, the poet subverts some of the genre’s conventions by meeting not a rustic woman but a beautiful and courteous noble lady in a context in which he would have normally met a <em>serrana</em>. The two of them strike up a conversation as they walk together. The end of the composition reveals that the encounter was a dream vision.</p>
