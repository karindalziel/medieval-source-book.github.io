Andando perdido, de noche ya era,
Wandering lost, it was already night,
por una montanna desierta, fraguosa,
By a deserted and craggy mountain
falle una uillana feroçe, espantosa,
I found a ferocious and hideous peasant woman
armada su mano con lança porquera.
Her hand armed with a javelin lance
Tenia grand fuego cabe una fontana
She was tending a big fire near a fountain
y en veiendome luego syn otra peresa
And then when she saw me, without thinking twice,
rebuelta en el braço una capa de lana
Her arm swathed in a wool cape,
saliome adelante con mucha ardidesa
She stepped forward much bravely
disiendo: “Escudero, ¿quien soys?, ¿que quereys
And said: “Who are you, squire, what are you looking for
por esta grand silua deshabitada?”
In this great, inhabited, woods?”
“Sennora, cruesa de mi enamorada
“My lover’s cruelty, madam,
me trahe fuyendo aquí donde ueys.”
Has made me escape here where you see me.”
“La perfection de nosotras, mugeres,
“Perfection in us, women
es de los trese fasta quinse annos;
Spans between our thirteenth and fifteenth year;
con estas se toman suaues plaseres
With such young women you will enjoy tender pleasures.
et todas las otras son llenas de engannos.
All others are full of deception.
Por ende, sennor, sy pasa los ueynte
So, sir, if over twenty years old is
aquella por quien soys tanto penado,
She for whom you are suffering so much,
sabed que seredes el mas padesciente
Know that you will continue to suffer the most
et syenpre os uereys ser menos amado.
And will always feel less loved.
“Amad, amadores, muger que non sabe,
“Lovers, love a woman who does not know,
a quien toda cosa paresca ser nueua,
One to whom everything seems new;
que quanto mas sabe muger menos uale,
The more a woman knows the less she is worth
segund por exemplo lo hemos de Eua,
As Eve exemplifies;
que luego comiendo el frutto de uida,
For after eating the fruit of life,
rompiendo el uelo de rica ignocencia
Breaking the veil of pleasant innocence,
supo su mal et su gloria perdida:
She learnt her troubles and lost her glory.
guardaos de muger que ha platica et scientia.
Beware of women who have practice and knowledge
“Amad, amadores, la tierna hedat,
“Lovers, love the tender age
quando el tiempo requiere natura
When time calls for nature;
‘questa non tiene ninguna crueldat
This age harbors no cruelty
nin offende al amante luenga tristura.
or afflicts a lover with enduring sadness.”

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The poem is copied in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, VITR/17/7, fol. 138r-139r. This manuscript is a copy of the poetry collection known as the Cancionero de Estúñiga, ca. 1465. It has been digitized: <a href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837">http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837</a>. It contains a compilation of mostly Castilian poems, including ballads, as well as a few Italian compositions. Their authors attended the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous, in Naples in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This poem is a <em>serranilla</em>, an evolution of the Provençal <em>pastorela</em>. Written in short verse (<em>arte menor</em>), <em>serranillas</em> narrate a courtly poet’s encounter with a mountain woman. This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous <em>serranillas</em>, Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this poem, the poet meets a fierce-looking wild woman who surprisingly offers courtly advice to the love-afflicted poet. It has been interpreted as a burlesque gloss of Juan Ruiz’s <em>Libro de buen amor</em>, one that conflates the serranas episodes with the discourse on <em>dueñas chicas</em> (‘little women,’ stanzas 1606-1617). The <em>Libro de buen amor</em> (1330/1343) is one of the masterpieces of medieval Castilian literature, a heterogenous, polysemous and oftentimes parodic text in which the narrator gives an account of his love life.</p>
