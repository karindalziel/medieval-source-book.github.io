  Facetia XIII
Joke 13
Dux Mediolani senior, Princeps in omnibus rebus elegantiae singularis, habebat cocum egregium quem usque ad Gallos ad perdiscenda obsonia miserat.
The older duke of Milan, a most refined ruler when all things were concerned, had a distinguished cook, whom he sent all the way to France to fully learn their dishes.
Bello, quod ingens cum Florentinis Dux habuit, cum ei aliquando non satis prosper nuntius advenisset, admodum turbavit Ducis mentem.
Once during the war, which the great duke waged against Florence, the duke became very upset because he had received less than favourable news.
Oblatis postmodum ad mensam epulis, sapores nescio quos cum Dux improbasset, epulas insuper, ut non rite conditas, esset aspernatus,
Later on at dinner a feast was presented, but the duke had rejected several sauces and had even spurned a dish for not being correctly spiced.
accitum cocum veluti ignarum artis aspere increpavit.
The cook was summoned and severely rebuked for not knowing his art.
Tum ille, ut erat liberior in eloquendo:
Since he was quite unrestrained in speaking out, the cook then said:
'Si Florentini,' inquit, 'tibi gustum atque appetitum auferunt, quae mea est culpa?
“If the Florentines have taken away your taste and appetite, why is that my fault?
My food is well-tasting and made with the highest skill: but the Florentines have roasted you thoroughly and taken away your appetite.”
Cibi enim mei sapidi sunt, et summa arte compositi: sed te nimium concalefaciunt, et appetitum auferunt Florentini.'
Risit ille, ut erat humanissimus, coci facetam in respondendo libertatem.
The duke, who was very humane, laughed at the cook’s elegant reply and the liberty he took.

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The <em>Facetiae</em> seems to have had immediate success. The collection as we now know it was composed between 1452-53, but Poggio had by then been working on versions of it (some of which had been in circulation) from as early as 1438. Over fifty manuscripts containing the text are preserved to this day. The <em>Facetiae</em> was also printed early and repeatedly, first appearing in this form around 1470. Another testimony to the popularity of the text is the fact that Poggio’s jokes or “conversations” were translated to several other languages, either the entire collection (into Italian and French at the end of the fifteenth century) or individual stories, which were mixed into the different Aesop collections circulating during this period. Herein lies somewhat of an irony, since Poggio himself in the introduction to the <em>Facetiae</em> seems to indicate that the object of writing them is to write stories in Latin that are usually told in the vernacular languages.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini (commonly referred to as simply Poggio Bracciolini) was born in Terranuova (Tuscany) in 1380. He died in Florence in 1459 at the age of seventy-nine. During his long life this early and important humanist had an equally long career at the Papal curia. In the service of a sequence of popes he lived in Rome, and travelled with the papal court all across Italy and the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Poggio produced a wide range of writing during his career (his collected works span four substantial volumes). He often worked in the dialogue form or wrote speeches, but he also wrote history. He was an avid book hunter and a skilled scribe.</p> <p>Through his texts we also meet a very polemical man, who seems to get into fights with many of his contemporaries, the most famous of which is his conflict with another of the humanist greats, Lorenzo Valla. The collections of jokes and stories known today as the <em>Facetiae</em>, but which Poggio himself preferred to refer to as Conversations (<em>Confabulationes</em>), certainly contains a polemical edge. While Poggio’s invectives are violently polemical and often personal, his <em>Facetiae</em> are more mildly polemical in the satirical tradition. The <em>Facetiae</em> as it is preserved consists of 273 jokes/stories ranging from just a few lines to a page in length. The collection also has an introduction and a type of conclusion. The short selection presented here contains a few rowdy jokes that poke fun at crude people and priests or monks, and another few stories with witty remarks from historical or contemporary characters. For readers interested in the obscene elements in the <em>Facetiae</em>, Poggio’s work can be compared to Beccadelli’s <em>The Hermaphrodite</em>, which offers another contemporary source of obscenity, but one based on very clear ancient models (among others Catullus). The selection shows that Poggio seems to have put his main focus on witticism when writing the stories; whether rude tales or short adventures of cooks, soldiers or even the famous Dante, the punchline seems almost always to be some sort of turn of phrase or wry observation (although this might not always be completely obvious to a modern reader).</p> <p>In this joke a nobleman accepts a sassy replay from a subordinate, proving that as long as something wicked is done with style it can be tolerated.</p>
