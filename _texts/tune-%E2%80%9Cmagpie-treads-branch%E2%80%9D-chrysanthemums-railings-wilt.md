## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose) his <em>ci</em> compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the <em>ci</em> of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness.</p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-b660f106-7fff-e393-b200-7cf00846c653">This song is written from the perspective of a woman reminiscing about her lover. This is one of the most famous examples of the <em>ci</em> genre, and one of the best-known works of Yan Shu. The song lyrics depict natural imagery which mirrors and amplifies the speaker’s feelings of loneliness.</p>
