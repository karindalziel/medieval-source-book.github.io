fulltext: '  Punctuation follows the edition. 清平樂 To the Tune “Qingping Music” 金風細細。 The gold wind The Autumn wind is gentle and tender, 葉葉梧桐墜。 The leaves of the parasol tree fall one by one. 綠酒初嘗人易醉。 The first taste of the green wine fine wine easily makes one tipsy. 一枕小窗濃睡。 Lying by the window, I sleep soundly. 紫薇朱槿花殘。 The crepe-myrtle and hibiscus have withered, 斜陽卻照闌干。 But the slanting sun still shines on the railing. 雙燕欲歸時節， It is the time when swallows are about to depart in pairs; 銀屏昨夜微寒。 Last night it was slightly cold behind the silver screen Refers to a protective screen that separates the girls’ room to the living room, where only men are allowed.

## Introduction to the Text 
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-daaf58ae-7fff-1549-d579-0b6e0dbabc16">Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose) his <em>ci</em> compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the <em>ci</em> of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness.</p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-33761aff-7fff-b044-0fd6-5c609502e564">By presenting autumn tropes and images that evoke the natural processes of decay, this song conveys the speaker’s feelings of loss and loneliness. Many readers may assume that the person being described is female, but there is really no unmistakable mark of this. A “gold” (or “metallic”) wind is the west wind, the wind of autumn, owing to associations between elements, directions, and seasons. The silver screen in the last line is the screen that stands before the speaker’s bed.</p>
